# SQLAlchemy Integration

`userharbor-sqlalchemy` provides `SQLAlchemyUserStore`, a `UserStore`
implementation backed by SQLAlchemy 2.x.

Repository:

```text
https://github.com/userharbor/userharbor-sqlalchemy
```

## Installation

```bash
pip install userharbor-sqlalchemy
```

This package depends on `userharbor` and SQLAlchemy 2.x.

You can also install it through the core package extra:

```bash
pip install "userharbor[sqlalchemy]"
```

## What it stores

The adapter persists:

* users
* password hashes
* email verification tokens
* sessions
* password reset tokens
* roles
* permissions
* user-to-role assignments
* role-to-permission assignments

Each user has at most one active email verification token and one active
password reset token. Storing a new token of either kind removes that user's
previous token. Users can have multiple active sessions.

It also updates session expiration when UserHarbor refreshes an active session.

Deleting a user through the store removes their tokens, sessions, and role
assignments in the same transaction. This also works with custom user models
and SQLite connections without foreign key enforcement. Role and permission
definitions, and other users' assignments, are preserved.

It does not send emails, expose HTTP endpoints, or implement
application-specific authentication flows.

## Basic usage

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from userharbor_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemyUserStore


engine = create_engine("sqlite:///users.db")
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(bind=engine)

store = SQLAlchemyUserStore(SessionLocal)
store.metadata.create_all(engine)
```

Pass `store` to `UserHarbor` as its `UserStore` implementation.

## Creating tables

The adapter exposes SQLAlchemy metadata through the store:

```python
store = SQLAlchemyUserStore(SessionLocal)

store.metadata.create_all(engine)
```

The built-in table names are:

* `userharbor_users`
* `userharbor_email_verifications`
* `userharbor_sessions`
* `userharbor_password_resets`
* `userharbor_roles`
* `userharbor_permissions`
* `userharbor_user_roles`
* `userharbor_role_permissions`

In applications that use migrations, include these models in your migration
metadata instead of calling `create_all()` at runtime.

## Alembic migrations

Applications that use Alembic should let migrations own schema creation. Do not
call `store.metadata.create_all(engine)` during application startup after
Alembic has been configured.

Install and initialize Alembic if the application does not already use it:

```bash
pip install alembic
alembic init migrations
```

### Keep the store definition separate

Define the SQLAlchemy store in a small module that only depends on the database
configuration:

```python
# app/user_store.py
from app.database import SessionLocal
from userharbor_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemyUserStore


user_store = SQLAlchemyUserStore(SessionLocal)
```

Import this store from both the application setup and Alembic. Avoid importing
the fully configured `UserHarbor` service from `migrations/env.py`: constructing
that service may require unrelated secrets, SMTP settings, or framework setup,
while Alembic only needs the store metadata.

### Configure target metadata

When the application uses its own declarative base and the built-in UserHarbor
user model, the application and UserHarbor have separate `MetaData` objects.
Alembic accepts a sequence of metadata collections for autogeneration:

```python
# migrations/env.py
# Import application models so they register with Base.metadata.
from app import models as _models
from app.database import Base
from app.user_store import user_store


target_metadata = [Base.metadata, user_store.metadata]
```

Keep the generated `target_metadata=target_metadata` argument in both calls to
`context.configure()`. Import every application model module before assigning
`target_metadata`; otherwise Alembic cannot detect those tables.

If UserHarbor owns all SQLAlchemy models in the application, a single metadata
collection is enough:

```python
target_metadata = user_store.metadata
```

Alembic requires table keys to be unique across a sequence of metadata
collections. See its documentation for
[autogenerating multiple metadata collections](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/autogenerate.html#autogenerating-multiple-metadata-collections).

### When using a custom user model

When `user_model` is provided, the adapter reuses that model's metadata for all
generated UserHarbor tables:

```python
# app/user_store.py
from app.database import SessionLocal
from app.models import AppUser
from userharbor_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemyUserStore


user_store = SQLAlchemyUserStore(
    SessionLocal,
    user_model=AppUser,
)
```

In that case, use the shared metadata once instead of passing the same metadata
twice:

```python
# migrations/env.py
from app import models as _models
from app.user_store import user_store


target_metadata = user_store.metadata
```

See [Custom user model](#custom-user-model) for the fields required by
`AppUser`.

### Generate and apply the migration

After configuring `target_metadata`, generate the migration:

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "create UserHarbor tables"
```

Review the generated migration before applying it. It should create the
UserHarbor tables listed above along with any pending application schema
changes. Then apply it and verify that the database matches the metadata:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
alembic check
```

Future adapter model changes can be handled through the same autogenerate,
review, and upgrade workflow.

## Custom user model

By default, the adapter creates and uses its own `userharbor_users` table. If
your application already owns a user table, pass that SQLAlchemy model as
`user_model`:

```python
from sqlalchemy import Boolean, String, create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import DeclarativeBase, Mapped, mapped_column, sessionmaker
from userharbor_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemyUserStore


class AppBase(DeclarativeBase):
    pass


class AppUser(AppBase):
    __tablename__ = "app_users"

    username: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(255), primary_key=True)
    username_key: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(255), unique=True, index=True)
    email: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(320), unique=True, index=True)
    password_hash: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(512))
    verified: Mapped[bool] = mapped_column(Boolean, default=False)
    display_name: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(255), default="Anonymous")


engine = create_engine("sqlite:///users.db")
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(bind=engine)

store = SQLAlchemyUserStore(
    SessionLocal,
    user_model=AppUser,
)
store.metadata.create_all(engine)
```

Custom user models must provide:

* `username`
* `username_key`
* `email`
* `password_hash`
* `verified`

`SQLAlchemyUserStore` writes `username.casefold()` to `username_key`. The
column must be unique so username lookup and uniqueness remain case-insensitive
while `username` preserves its original casing.

The token and role assignment tables are still created by the adapter. Their
user foreign keys point to the table configured through `user_model`. When a
custom user model is provided, the adapter reuses that model's metadata, so
`store.metadata` contains both the application user model and the generated
UserHarbor token, role, permission, and assignment models.

## Custom user mapping

By default, SQLAlchemy user rows are mapped to a small public user object with
`username`, `email`, and `verified`. Pass `user_mapper` when your application
wants to return a richer public user type:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass
class AppPublicUser:
    username: str
    email: str
    verified: bool
    display_name: str


store = SQLAlchemyUserStore(
    SessionLocal,
    user_model=AppUser,
    user_mapper=lambda user: AppPublicUser(
        username=user.username,
        email=user.email,
        verified=user.verified,
        display_name=user.display_name,
    ),
)
```

`user_mapper` is used by `get_user_by_username()` and `get_user_by_email()`.
Token methods continue to return `UserToken` values.

## Roles and permissions

`SQLAlchemyUserStore` implements the complete role and permission persistence
contract required by UserHarbor:

```python
harbor.roles.create("admin")
harbor.permissions.create("users.delete")
harbor.roles.grant_permission("admin", "users.delete")
harbor.grant_role("jane", "admin")
```

Roles and permissions are stored separately from users. User permissions are
derived through the `userharbor_user_roles` and `userharbor_role_permissions`
tables.

Deleting a role removes that role from users and removes its permission
assignments. Deleting a permission removes it from every role.

## Sessions and transactions

`SQLAlchemyUserStore` receives a session factory:

```python
store = SQLAlchemyUserStore(SessionLocal)
```

Each store method opens a session when no UserHarbor transaction is active.
`SQLAlchemyUserStore.transaction()` is used by UserHarbor for multi-step
operations such as email verification, password reset, password change, account
deletion, and other flows that need related writes to commit or roll back
together.

Role and permission methods use the same session handling as the account and
token methods.

Successful transaction blocks are committed. Exceptions roll back changes from
the block.

Session refreshes are persisted by the store when UserHarbor's sliding session
expiration is enabled.
